## 🧭 Trainers and Skill Tiers

You must visit higher-tier trainers at specific skill levels to advance.

| Skill Tier | Required Skill | Required Character Level | Key Trainer Locations (Examples) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apprentice** | 1 | 5 | Starting area trainers (e.g., **Daryl Riknussun** in Ironforge, **Daryl Stack** in Orgrimmar) |
| **Journeyman** | 50 | 10 | **Sellandus** in The Barrens (Ratchet) or **Stormwind**. **Note:** Some city trainers may only be Apprentice. |
| **Expert** | 125 | 20 | **Georgio Bolero** in Stormwind Trade District, **Grimnur Stonebrand** in Ironforge, **Dalmond** in Thelsamar. |
| **Artisan** | 200 | 35 | **Timothy Worthington** in Stormwind, **Daryl Riknussun** in Ironforge. Complete the **"Artisan Tailoring"** quest. |

**Crucial Tip:** If a trainer won't teach you the next rank, talk to them. They often tell you where to go. The trainer for **Expert (150-225)** in Stormwind is **Georgio Bolero** inside Duncan's Textiles.

## 📈 Efficient Leveling Path (1-300)

This path prioritizes trainer-taught recipes to avoid farming rare patterns, with economical alternatives noted.

### **1 - 75 (Linen)**
*   **1-45:** Bolt of Linen Cloth (2 Linen Cloth each).
*   **45-60:** Brown Linen Robe (3 Bolts, 1 Coarse Thread). *Good for disenchanting.*
*   **60-75:** Reinforced Linen Cape (2 Bolts, 1 Coarse Thread). *Cheaper thread than shirts.*

**Cloth Needed:** ~100-120 Linen Cloth.

### **75 - 150 (Wool & Silk)**
*   **75-105:** Bolt of Woolen Cloth (3 Wool Cloth each).
*   **105-110:** Gray Woolen Shirt (2 Bolts, 1 Fine Thread). *Can be disenchanted.*
*   **110-125:** Double-stitched Woolen Shoulders (3 Bolts, 1 Fine Thread).
*   **125-145:** Bolt of Silk Cloth (4 Silk Cloth each).
*   **145-150:** Azure Silk Hood (2 Bolts, 2 Fine Thread). *Alternative: White Linen Robe (Linen) is cheaper if skill is green.*

**Bag Tip:** Craft **Small Silk Pack** (Skill 125) if you have Heavy Leather. Send to alts or sell.

### **150 - 225 (Mageweave)**
*   **150-170:** Bolt of Mageweave (4 Mageweave Cloth each).
*   **170-185:** Crimson Silk Vest (4 Bolts, 2 Silken Thread, 2 Fine Dye). *Alternative: Red Swashbuckler's Shirt at 175 uses cheaper vendor mats.*
*   **185-205:** Black Mageweave Headband (2 Bolts, 1 Heavy Silken Thread).
*   **205-220:** Black Mageweave Leggings (2 Bolts, 2 Silken Thread).
*   **220-225:** Black Mageweave Boots (2 Bolts, 2 Heavy Silken Thread). *This is a green recipe, have extra materials.*

**Highly Efficient Alternative (Bags):**
*   **225-240/255:** Mageweave Bag.
*   **235-250/265:** Red Mageweave Bag.
*   Sell bags on the Auction House (AH) to fund your leveling.

### **225 - 300 (Runecloth) - THE CHALLENGE**
The final stretch is notorious due to limited, camped patterns. Have a backup plan.
*   **225-250:** Bolt of Runecloth (5 Runecloth each).
*   **250-275:** Runecloth Belt (3 Bolts, 1 Rune Thread). A reliable trainer recipe.
*   **275-300 (The Wall):** This is the hardest part.
    *   **Goal Pattern (Camped):** **Runecloth Bag** pattern sold by **Qia** in Winterspring. It's heavily camped by players and may be unavailable.
    *   **Goal Pattern (Camped):** **Runecloth Gloves** pattern, also sold by Qia.
    *   **Backup - AH/World Drop:** **Brightcloth Gloves/Robe** or **Runecloth Headband** patterns.
    *   **Last Resort:** Continue making **Runecloth Belts** from 275, but it will take hundreds of cloth as it turns green. Check the AH for cheap **Runecloth Bags** or **Mooncloth** recipes to craft.

**Community Advice:** The guide's path beyond 275 is often **not viable** due to pattern scarcity. Be prepared to use the AH, farm gold for made bags, or grind massive Runecloth.

## ⚠️ Important Notes & Community Tips

*   **No Specializations in Classic:** Tailoring specializations (Mooncloth, Shadoweave, Spellfire) were added in *The Burning Crusade*. They do not exist in WoW Classic.
*   **Disenchanting is Your Friend:** Crafting items like **Gray Woolen Shirts** or **Brown Linen Robes** to disenchant can be more valuable than vendoring.
*   **Cloth Requirements Vary:** The total cloth needed depends heavily on your chosen path (e.g., making bags requires more cloth but can be profitable). Always farm/gather extra.
*   **Recipe Availability in Season of Discovery (SoD):** Be aware that in the Season of Discovery version of Classic, some high-level pattern vendors (like Qia in Winterspring) or their patterns may be temporarily removed.
*   **Save Your Mageweave:** The **White Bandit Mask** (1 Bolt of Mageweave, 1 Bleach, 1 Heavy Silken Thread) is an incredibly cheap and fast skill-up around skill 215-230 and often sells well to Rogues.

## 🎯 Final Advice

1.  **Plan for the 275-300 Wall:** Start researching the **Runecloth Bag** and **Gloves** patterns early. Assume you will need an expensive backup plan involving the Auction House.
2.  **Craft Bags to Sell:** Using bag recipes (Mageweave, Red Mageweave) during leveling can offset costs and is often more material-efficient for skill-ups.
3.  **Pair with Enchanting:** This is the classic combo. Disenchant all your greens and useless crafted items for materials to sell or use.
4.  **Farm Smart:** Humanoids drop cloth. Plan your character leveling zones to coincide with the cloth type you need (e.g., Scarlet Monastery for Silk/Wool, Hinterlands for Mageweave, Plaguelands for Runecloth).

Good luck, and may your bolts be ever full!
