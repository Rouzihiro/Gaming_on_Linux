# How to Get Your Tent in Turtle WoW (Level 15+)

This guide details how to obtain the Tent, an item that grants accelerated rest experience regeneration. The process is designed for Alliance players, with a note for Horde players.

## **Alliance Guide (Starting from Stormwind)**

### 1. The Goblin & Arena
*   Travel to the Stormwind Bank.
*   Speak to the **goblin** located there, who will send you to the Arena in Stranglethorn Vale (STV).

### 2. First Death & Journey to Booty Bay
*   Enter the Arena, then **exit outside**.
*   Run **south** as far as you possibly can until you **die**.
*   Release spirit at the **graveyard** that appears near Booty Bay.

### 3. Purchasing Goblin Oil
*   Run into Booty Bay.
*   At the port authority, find the **Engineering vendor** and purchase **Goblin Oil (45 silver)**.
*   Acquire the **Booty Bay Flight Path**.

### 4. Return to Stormwind
*   Take the **boat from Booty Bay to Ratchet**. Get the flight path there.
*   Use a **Meeting Stone** (e.g., to summon a group member) to return instantly to Stormwind.

### 5. Second Trip & Final Journey to Camp
*   Speak to the **same goblin** in Stormwind Bank and return to the Arena.
*   Exit the Arena, but this time run **north carefully** until you die.
*   Release at the **graveyard**. From there, **jump down and head across the river** towards the visible dock.

### 6. Acquiring the Tent
*   You will find a small camp. Here you can:
    *   Get the relevant quest.
    *   **Purchase the Tent.**
    *   Purchase the Rope.
    *   Pick up the Wood found on the ground.

### 7. Completion
*   Use your **Hearthstone** to return home.
*   **Level your Survival skill to 75 while inside an Inn** to be able to use the tent.

## **Horde Shortcut Guide**

This route is generally considered easier.

1.  Start in **Ratchet**. Take the **boat to Booty Bay**.
2.  In Booty Bay, purchase the **Goblin Oil (45s)** from the Engineering vendor.
3.  Take the **boat back to Ratchet**.
4.  Travel to the **Zeppelin tower outside Orgrimmar** (for Grom'gol Base Camp).
5.  Take the **Zeppelin to Stranglethorn Vale (STV)**. You will arrive very close to the target camp.
6.  **Die** to position your spirit at the nearby graveyard.
7.  Follow **Steps 10, 11, and 12** from the Alliance guide above:
    *   Release, jump down, cross the river to the dock.
    *   Go to the camp to get the quest, buy the Tent and Rope, and pick up the Wood.
    *   Hearthstone out and level Survival to 75 in an inn.
