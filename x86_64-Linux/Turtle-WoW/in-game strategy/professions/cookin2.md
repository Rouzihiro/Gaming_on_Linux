## 📈 Recommended Leveling Path (1-300)

This is a generalized skill-up path. Using **Fishing to supply ingredients is the most efficient and economical method.** Always keep your training up to date.

### **1 - 40: Simple Recipes**
*   **Spiced Wolf Meat** (Requires 1x Stringy Wolf Meat, 1x Mild Spices)
    *   Farm wolves in starting zones.
*   Alternatively, cook any **"**[**Recipe: ....**]**"** you find that uses meat from local beasts.

### **40 - 100: Transitioning Recipes**
*   **Curiously Tasty Omelette** (Requires 1x Raptor Egg)
    *   **Note:** This recipe is learned at skill **130**, not 100. It cannot be used for the 100-130 gap.
*   **Smoked Bear Meat** (Requires 1x Bear Meat)
*   **Cooked Crab Claw** (Requires 1x Crawler Claw)

### **100 - 175: Filling the Gap**
This is a common hurdle. Here are the best options:
*   **Horde Alternative (100-130): Dig Rat Stew**
    *   Buy the recipe from **Wrahk** in the hut just east of The Crossroads, Barrens.
    *   Ingredients: 1x Dig Rat, 1x Refreshing Spring Water.
    *   Farm Dig Rats at the dwarven digsite in Southern Barrens.
*   **Fishing Route (Highly Recommended): Bristle Whisker Catfish**
    *   Fish for **Raw Bristle Whisker Catfish** in Ashenvale.
    *   The recipe turns green at ~160, so gather extra (around 75-100).
*   **Lean Wolf Steak** (Recipe sold in Desolace) can bridge gaps.

### **175 - 225: Monster Parts & Fish**
*   **Raptors in Stranglethorn Vale (STV) or Arathi Highlands are excellent.**
    *   They drop both **Raptor Flesh** (for **Roast Raptor**) and **Raptor Eggs** (for omelettes).
*   **Spotted Yellowtail**
    *   Fish in coastal zones like Stranglethorn Vale. Orange from 225-265.

### **225 - 275: The Artisan Grind**
*   Complete the **Artisan Cooking Quest** in Gadgetzan at 225 skill.
*   **Nightfin Soup** (Requires 1x Raw Nightfin Snapper, 1x Refreshing Spring Water)
    *   A reliable recipe to reach 285.
*   **Poached Sunscale Salmon** (Requires 1x Raw Sunscale Salmon)

### **275 - 300: The Final Push**
This is the most challenging gap without Fishing.
*   **Giant Clam Scorcho** (Requires 1x Giant Clam Meat) – Farm clams.
*   **Grilled Squid** (Requires 1x Winter Squid) – Requires Fishing.
*   **Smoked Desert Dumplings** (Requires 1x Sandworm Meat)
    *   **Crucial:** The recipe vendor in Silithus does **NOT** appear until you have **285** Cooking skill. You cannot use this to get from 275 to 285.
*   **Alternative (AH):** Buy **Raw Nightfin Snapper** or **Raw Whitescale Salmon** from the Auction House if you are not leveling Fishing.

## ⚠️ Important Notes & Community Tips

*   **Faction Imbalance:** The original guide is heavily Alliance-focused. Horde players should pay close attention to the alternative recipes listed above (e.g., Dig Rat Stew).
*   **You Can Cook on Any Fire:** This includes campfires, fireplaces, stoves, and even **NPC-held torches** in cities like Orgrimmar.
*   **Useful Quest Recipes:**
    *   **Strider Stew:** Available to **Alliance** via a quest in Auberdine, Darkshore.
    *   **Kaldorei Spider Kabob:** Available to **Alliance** via a quest in Teldrassil.
*   **Rogue Class Item:** **Thistle Tea** is made with the Cooking skill.
*   **High-Level Buff Food:** **Dragonbreath Chili** (sold in Dustwallow Marsh) is a powerful melee food (don't jump in water!).
*   **Artisan Quest Tip:** When flying from Orgrimmar to Gadgetzan, stop in Thousand Needles to buy **Alterac Swiss** from the innkeeper (requires level 45 to use, but not to purchase).

## 🎣 Final Advice

1.  **Level Fishing:** It is the single best piece of advice for a smooth, cheap Cooking leveling experience.
2.  **Plan for the 275-285 Gap:** This is the most notorious wall. Either level Fishing to farm Nightfin Snapper, be prepared to farm hundreds of Giant Eggs/Tender Wolf Meat, or save gold to buy fish on the Auction House.
3.  **Check the Auction House** for cheap meats and recipes to fill unexpected gaps.
4.  **Raptors are Your Friend:** From 130-235, STV and Arathi raptors provide an incredible density of both meat and eggs.

Good luck, and may your feasts be bountiful!
