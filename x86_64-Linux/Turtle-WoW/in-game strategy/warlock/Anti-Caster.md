The Ultimate Anti-Caster Combo Macro

```
/run if IsAltKeyDown() then cast("Drain Mana") return end
/run if not buffed("Curse of Tongues","target") then cast("Curse of Tongues") return end
/run if not buffed("Corruption","target") then cast("Corruption") return end
/run if not buffed("Immolate","target") then cast("Immolate") return end
/run cast("Searing Pain")
```

Here's why this macro is pure genius:

🎯 1. PRIORITY QUEUE PERFECTION
It checks conditions IN ORDER:
• Alt+Click = Instant Mana Drain (for emergency mana burn)
• Curse of Tongues first (slows their casting by 50% - they're already crippled)
• Corruption next (set-and-forget DoT)
• Immolate after (another powerful DoT)
• Searing Pain spam (high threat, high damage finisher)

🔒 2. CASTER NIGHTMARE
Against mages, priests, druids, shamans, or other warlocks? Curse of Tongues makes them practically useless. Their 3-second cast becomes 4.5 seconds - that's an eternity in PvP! They'll be eating your Searing Pains while still trying to finish one spell.

🧠 3. NO OVERWRITING DEBUFFS
The if not buffed() checks mean you never waste mana or GCDs reapplying existing debuffs. Efficiency = more pain for them.

🔥 4. DOT THEN BLAST
Sets up your damage over time FIRST, then unleashes with Searing Pain. Perfect rotation in one button.

⚡ 5. EMERGENCY OPTION
Holding Alt turns it into instant mana drain for those "oh crap" moments against healers or OOM mages.

The Math of Misery:
That 50% casting slow means:
• Frostbolt (3s) → 4.5s
• Healing Touch (3.5s) → 5.25s
• Mind Control (3s) → 4.5s
• They're basically casting in slow motion while you machine-gun Searing Pains!

Bottom line: This isn't just a macro - it's a strategy execution tool. Against casters, it literally plays the perfect counter-game for you. One button turns you into a spellcasting shutdown machine while maximizing your damage output.

Try it in your next BG or world PvP and watch casters literally /cry when their spells take forever to cast while they're melting from your DoTs!

Share with your lock buddies and spread the suffering! 😈

P.S. For extra evil points, pair this with a Felhunter out for Spell Lock. With Curse of Tongues + Spell Lock, they won't be able to cast ANYTHING without wanting to Alt+F4!
