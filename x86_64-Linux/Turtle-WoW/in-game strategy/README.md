# Rogue Leveling Guide: The Ambush & Backstab Playstyle

## Playstyle Philosophy
This guide focuses on an aggressive, stealth-first approach centered on massive opening damage from **Ambush** and high burst from **Backstab**. It leverages high critical strike chance for big, satisfying numbers and fast open-world kills.

### Core Combat Loop
1.  **Engage:** Stealth → move quickly to target (Camouflage talent).
2.  **Open:** Ambush (with high crit chance from talents).
3.  **Finish:** Follow up with Sinister Strike (or Backstab if positioned).
4.  **Reset:** Target dies, granting the **Remorseless Attacks** buff.
5.  **Repeat:** Use Stealth (5-sec cooldown) and move to next target.

## Talent Build Progression (Assassination/Subtlety Hybrid)

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Levels 10-27)
*   **Levels 10-11:** **Remorseless Attacks (2/2)** – After killing a target, your next Ambush, Backstab, or Sinister Strike has a 40% increased critical strike chance. *Essential for chain-pulling.*
*   **Levels 12-16:** **Camouflage (5/5)** – Reduces Stealth cooldown to 5 seconds and increases movement speed while Stealthed. *Huge for mobility.*
*   **Levels 17-19:** **Improved Ambush (3/3)** – Increases the critical strike chance of your Ambush by 45%. *Massively boosts your opener.*
*   **Levels 20-24:** **Opportunity (5/5)** – Increases the damage of your Ambush and Backstab by 20%. *Direct damage multiplier.*
*   **Levels 25-27:** **Improved Backstab (3/3)** – Gives your Backstab a 30% critical strike chance bonus and a 45% chance to add an extra combo point.

**At Level 27:** You have a powerful, synergistic toolkit for open-world leveling.

## Respecialization & Endgame Considerations

You can respec at any class trainer for a cost. This build is optimized for fast leveling with daggers.

**Around Level 38-40**, consider a more standardized endgame build:
*   **Combat Swords:** The "cookie-cutter" PvE spec. Reliable but less bursty.
*   **Combat Daggers:** Retains big Backstab crits with Combat tree benefits.
*   **Assassination:** Focuses on poison damage and Seal Fate.

**Personal Recommendation:** I stayed with a daggers/Assassination-focused build. The thrill of constant critical strikes was more enjoyable than the standard Combat rotation.
