# Survival

## Overview
**Survival** is a secondary profession in Turtle WoW that allows players to craft tools and equipment to help them overcome obstacles and thrive in the wilderness. It is available to all characters regardless of their other profession choices.

Survivalists learn outdoor skills necessary for surviving the dangers of Azeroth. With the right materials, they can create shelter and heat sources to endure the untamed wilds. Key items like torches and tents can be crafted almost anywhere, provided you have the required ingredients:
- **Torches**: Unlit torches
- **Tents**: Linen cloth, simple wood, and sturdy rope

## Uses
### Primary Benefits
- **Traveler's Tent**: The standout feature of Survival. This tent provides increased rested experience at a rate higher than staying at an inn. The rested experience cap remains the standard: `[current level XP needed to level] × 1.5`.
- **Gardening**: Unlocked by completing the quest **"You Reap What You Sow"** (Level 32 [60]), available from:
  - **Mortimer Stansfield** outside Stormwind City (Elwynn Forest) – Alliance
  - **Kern Mosshoof** in Bloodhoof Village (Mulgore) – Horde
  Gardening allows players to grow their own food, which provides stat increases that can stack with bonuses from Cooking food.

Once trained, you can start crafting Dim Torches immediately, with an initial skill cap of 75.

## Training Locations
- **Primary Trainer**: **Rufus Hardwick** at Nesingwary's Expedition in Stranglethorn Vale. He teaches both ranks of Survival.
- **Gardening Recipe**: The **Simple Wooden Planter** recipe is taught by gardening trainers (Mortimer Stansfield or Kern Mosshoof) after completing **"You Reap What You Sow"**.

**Gardening Zones** are located:
- Outside Stormwind City (Elwynn Forest) – Alliance
- In Bloodhoof Village (Mulgore) – Horde

## Notes & Trivia
- Originally, Survival was started by accepting the quest **"Night's Exploration"** from **Sir S. J. Erlgadin** at Nesingwary's Expedition. The quest required obtaining:
  - A Wooden Club
  - Sturdy Rope from **Jaquilina Dramet** at Nesingwary's Camp
  - Cheap Goblin's Oil from **Mazk Snipeshot** in Booty Bay
- In the past, recipes were sold by Rufus Hardwick instead of being taught, and Journeyman Survival was automatically learned upon reaching the required skill level.
