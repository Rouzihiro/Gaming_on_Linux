# WoW Classic Alliance Leveling & Farming Guide (Level 25-40)

## Level: 20
### Immediate "What Should I Do Now?" Table

| Zone | Level Range | Alliance Hub | Pros for a Warlock | Cons / Warnings |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Duskwood** | **22-30** | Darkshire | **TOP CHOICE.** Dense, spooky, fantastic quest density. Perfect mob levels (worgen, ghouls, spiders). Quest rewards are excellent. | Heavy competition on busy servers. Elite Stitches patrols. |
| **Wetlands** (Remaining) | 20-30 | Menethil Harbor | You're already there/familiar. Higher-level quests in the north (Gnoll, Dragonmaw Orcs) are great for 26+. | Some quests may be green/grey. Travel time within zone is long. |
| **Redridge Mountains** | 15-25 | Lakeshire | You can easily finish all quests here, including the elite "Orc Assassin" chain. Quick completion for XP. | Many quests will be low-green yield. More of a "clean-up" stop. |
| **Ashenvale** | 18-30 | Astranaar | Good change of scenery, many quests. The Satyr (Demon) farm spots are great for Warlocks (soul shards!). | Very spread out. Heavy Horde presence on PvP servers. |
| **Hillsbrad Foothills** | **20-30** | Southshore | **New zone for you.** Iconic, quest-rich, great for late 20s. Humanoid mobs = good for fear & shards. | **PvP hotspot.** Tarren Mill (Horde) is nearby. Can be chaotic. |

## Your "Where to Go Next" Roadmap (Levels 25-40)

| Level Range | Primary Zone (Priority) | Secondary Zone | Dungeon for Gear/XP | Key Warlock Farming Notes |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **25-28** | **Duskwood** (Darkshire) | Wetlands (Northern) | **Scarlet Monastery - Library/Graveyard (28+)** | Farm **Sorrow Hill** undead for **Linen/Cash/Cloth**. Great for Voidwalker tanking. |
| **28-31** | **Stranglethorn Vale (North)** - Nesingwary | Hillsbrad Foothills (Southshore) | **Scarlet Monastery - Armory/Cath (31+)** | **STV is a goldmine.** Hunt cats & raptors for vendor loot/skinning. **Expect world PvP.** |
| **30-35** | **Stranglethorn Vale (South)** - Booty Bay | **Arathi Highlands (32+)** | **Razorfen Downs (35+)** | In STV, use **Succubus + Seduction** for 2-mob camps (Bloodscalp Trolls). Fear in jungle is risky. |
| **33-38** | **Arathi Highlands** (Refuge Pointe) | **Desolace** (Nijel's Point) | **SM Cathedral / RFD** | **Arathi Humanoids** = great loot/silver. Farm **Stromgarde** with Succubus CC. |
| **36-42** | **Badlands** (Kargath - FP via Searing Gorge) | **Dustwallow Marsh** (Theramore) | **Uldaman (36-42)** | **Badlands** = great for demonic/stone elementals. Use VW for tanking elementals. |
| **38-43** | **Swamp of Sorrows** (Stonard is Horde, but Alliance has quests at the beacon) | **Feralas** (Feathermoon Stronghold) | **Zul'Farrak (42-46)** | **Swamp Jaga** & **Lost Ones** - good humanoid loot. Feralas is rich but spread out. |

## Warlock-Specific Farming Spots at Level 25-26

If you need to **grind mobs for XP, cloth, or silver**, here are targeted spots:

| Location | Mob Type | Level Range | Why It's Good for Warlocks | Pet Choice |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Duskwood - Sorrow Hill** | Undead (Grave Ghouls, etc.) | 24-27 | **High cloth drop rate.** Undead have no fear resistance in Classic. Easy to fear-juggle. **Great for farming** linen/wool. | **Voidwalker** for safety. |
| **Wetlands - Mosshide Fen** | Mosshide Gnolls | 23-26 | Dense spawns, good vendor loot. Low armor = good shadowbolt damage. | **Voidwalker** to tank multiple. |
| **Redridge - Stonewatch Keep** | Blackrock Orcs | 23-26 | Good cloth & grey drops. Orcs are humanoid, can be feared (careful with patrols). | **Succubus** to CC one if pulling multiple. |
| **Ashenvale - Satyr Camps** (Xavian, south of Astranaar) | Demons (Satyr) | 23-27 | **Demons = extra roleplay flavor.** Good loot, and you can drain their mana! | **Voidwalker** recommended. |
| **Hillsbrad - Southshore Farms** | Syndicate Humanoids | 24-28 | Excellent silver & silk cloth drops. **But this is a massive PvP warzone.** Only go if you enjoy conflict. | **Succubus** for PvP readiness. |

## Quick Tips for Level 26 Warlock

1.  **Pet Choice:** Use **Voidwalker** for safe solo grinding. Switch to **Succubus** for Crowd Control (2+ mobs) or PvP.
2.  **Key Ability:** You now have **Drain Life (Rank 2)** – great for sustainability.
3.  **Dungeon Alert:** Start looking for **Scarlet Monastery** groups at **Level 28**. The Graveyard wing drops the **Gravestone Scepter**, a fantastic wand.
4.  **Hearthstone:** Set it to **Southshore** (Hillsbrad) or **Darkshire** (Duskwood) depending on your chosen zone.
