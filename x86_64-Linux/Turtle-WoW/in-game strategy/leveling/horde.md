|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Stonetalon Mountains** | **15-27** | Sun Rock Retreat | **TOP CHOICE for 25-27.** Excellent quest density. Southern quests (Charred Vale) are perfect. Many humanoids for fear. | Terrain is vertical. Lower-level areas to avoid. |

## Your "Where to Go Next" Roadmap (Levels 25-40)

| Level Range | Primary Zone (Priority) | Secondary Zone | Dungeon for Gear/XP | Key Warlock Farming Notes |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **25-28** | **Stonetalon Mountains** (Sun Rock) / **Hillsbrad** (Tarren Mill) | Thousand Needles (Shimmering Flats) | **Razorfen Kraul (25-30)** / **Scarlet Monastery (30+)** | Farm **Charred Vale** in Stonetalon for satyrs/demons. Use Voidwalker. |
| **28-31** | **Thousand Needles** (Freewind Post) | **Arathi Highlands (30+)** via boat | **Scarlet Monastery - Armory/Cath (31+)** | **Shimmering Flats** is great XP. Use Succubus to CC one mob in packs. |
| **30-35** | **Stranglethorn Vale** (Grom'gol Base Camp) | **Arathi Highlands** (Hammerfall) | **Razorfen Downs (35+)** | **STV is PvP chaos.** Trolls & cats = good farm. Fear in jungle = dangerous. |

| **36-42** | **Badlands** (Kargath) | **Dustwallow Marsh** (Brackenwall Village) | **Uldaman (36-42)** | Farm rock elementals & demons. Voidwalker tanks them well. |
| **38-43** | **Swamp of Sorrows** (Stonard) | **Feralas** (Camp Mojache) | **Zul'Farrak (42-46)** | Swamp of Sorrows humanoids = good loot. Feralas has great quest density. |

|----------|----------|-------------|---------------------------|------------|

## Horde Travel & Navigation Guide

| Route | From → To | Instructions |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **To Stonetalon** | Orgrimmar → Sun Rock Retreat | 1. Zeppelin/tram to Undercity? No. From Orgrimmar, take the west exit to The Barrens. 2. Run north-west through The Barrens to the Stonetalon mountains entrance (near the Mor'shan Rampart). 3. Follow path up into the mountains to Sun Rock. |
| **To Thousand Needles** | Orgrimmar/Camp Taurajo → Freewind Post | 1. Go to The Barrens (Camp Taurajo in south). 2. Find the **Great Lift** in the far south-west corner. 3. Take elevator down. 4. Freewind Post is directly south. |
| **To Hillsbrad** | Undercity → Tarren Mill | 1. From Undercity, take the front gate east into **Tirisfal Glades**. 2. Follow road south into **Silverpine Forest**. 3. Continue south through Sepulcher to **Hillsbrad**. 4. Tarren Mill is in the south-east part of the zone. |
| **To Arathi Highlands** | Undercity → Hammerfall | 1. From Undercity, go to the **Zeppelin Tower**. 2. Take zeppelin to **Grom'gol** in STV? No, for Arathi, take the zeppelin to **Orgrimmar**? Actually, the direct route: Fly to Tarren Mill (Hillsbrad). Run east through Hillsbrad, into **Alterac Mountains**, then south into **Arathi**. The zeppelin from Undercity goes to Orgrimmar, not directly to Arathi. |

## Horde Warlock Class Tips (Level 26)

1.  **Pet Choice:** Default to **Voidwalker** for safe questing. Use **Succubus** for PvP zones (Hillsbrad, STV) or for CC in camps.
2.  **Soul Shard Management:** Farm extra shards before dungeons. Humanoid-rich zones (Hillsbrad, Arathi) are perfect.
3.  **Dungeon Prep:** At **Level 28**, look for **Scarlet Monastery** groups (from Undercity). At **Level 25**, **Razorfen Kraul** is doable for the quests.
4.  **Key Skills:** You have **Drain Life Rank 2** for sustain. **Curse of Recklessness** is excellent to prevent fear from runners in PvP.

## Dungeon Quest Checklist (Level 25-30)

| Dungeon | Level | Key Quests (Start) | Why Run It? |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Razorfen Kraul** | 25-30 | "The Blood Shard" (Camp Taurajo), "A Crisis in the Desert" (Thousand Needles) | Good XP, quest rewards, and practice for RFD later. |
| **Scarlet Monastery (Graveyard)** | 28-32 | "At War With The Scarlet Crusade" (Undercity), "Morrowgrain Research" (Felwood later) | **Best XP dungeon** at this level. Drops great gear like **Gravestone Scepter**. |
| **Scarlet Monastery (Library/Armory)** | 30-34 | Same as above, plus class quests. | Continuation, more XP, better loot like **Hypnotic Blade**. |

---

**Next Major Goal:** Reach **Level 28** and run **Scarlet Monastery Graveyard** repeatedly for gear and massive XP.
