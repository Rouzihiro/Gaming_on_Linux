## Build Strengths & Playstyle
This hybrid excels by combining the best of both worlds:

*   **Core Sustained Damage:** The Combat tree provides the essential foundation with **Precision** (hit chance) and **Dual Wield Specialization** for reliable frontal damage, just like your previous build.
*   **Poison & Critical Strike Synergy:** The Assassination investment makes your poisons significantly more potent and reliable (**Improved Poisons, Vile Poisons**). Talents like **Malice** and **Lethality** amplify your critical strike potential, which works perfectly with **Ruthlessness** and **Relentless Strikes** for more combo points and energy.
*   **Key Abilities & Rotation:**
    *   **Opener:** Use **Garrote** (for DoT) or **Cheap Shot** (for control) from Stealth.
    *   **Core Loop:** Build combo points with **Sinister Strike**. Use **Envenom** as your primary finisher to maximize poison damage, or **Slice and Dice** (enhanced by **Improved Blade Tactics**) for sustained fights. Use **Rupture** (empowered by **Taste for Blood**) for a strong damage-over-time effect and personal damage buff.
    *   **Procs:** Utilize **Surprise Attack** whenever it procs after a dodge.
*   **Weapon Choice:** This build is optimized for **Swords or Axes**, fully utilizing the **Hack and Slash** talent. The **Weapon Expertise** talent is critical for all weapon types against high-level targets.
