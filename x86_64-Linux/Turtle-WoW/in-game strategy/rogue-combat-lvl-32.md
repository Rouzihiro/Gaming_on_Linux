The strategy utilizes **Stealth openers (Garrote or Cheap Shot)** and adapts **Tier 6 talents based on your primary weapon choice**.

## Detailed Talent Table
The following table details all talents taken in this build. Talents not listed were not selected.

| **Tree** | **Tier** | **Talent Name** | **Rank** | **Effect** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Combat** | 1 | Lightning Reflexes | 5/5 | Increases your Dodge chance by 5%. |
| **Combat** | 2 | Precision | 5/5 | Increases your chance to hit with melee weapons by 5%. |
| **Combat** | 3 | Improved Sprint | 2/2 | Gives a 100% chance to remove all movement-impairing effects when you activate Sprint. |
| **Combat** | 3 | Setup | 3/3 | Gives a 45% chance to add a combo point after dodging an attack or fully resisting a spell. |
| **Combat** | 4 | Dual Wield Specialization | 5/5 | Increases the damage done by your offhand weapon by 50%. |
| **Combat** | 5 | Surprise Attack | 1/1 | A guaranteed hit after a target dodges, dealing damage based on Attack Power and awarding 1 combo point. |
| **Combat** | 6 | **Weapon Expertise** | **2/2** | **Increases weapon skill by 5, crucial for hitting higher-level enemies.** |

**Key Note on Tier 6:** The final 2 points are placed in **Weapon Expertise** as a universal and powerful choice for fighting mobs above your level. As you progress, these points can be relocated to other Tier 6 talents based on your weapon specialization:
*   **Swords/Axes:** Consider **Hack and Slash** for an extra attack chance.
*   **Daggers/Fist Weapons/Maces:** Consider **Close Quarters Combat** for increased critical strike chance.
*   **General Attack Speed:** **Blade Rush** is another excellent option for overall performance.

## Build Philosophy & Playstyle
*   **Sustained Frontal Damage:** Core talents like **Precision** and **Dual Wield Specialization** maximize consistent damage output from the front, removing the need for positional attacks.
*   **Stealth Opener Utility:** While this build doesn't invest in Subtlety, opening from stealth with **Cheap Shot** (for control) or **Garrote** (for damage over time) is still highly effective to initiate combat on your terms.
*   **Survivability & Synergy:** **Lightning Reflexes** and **Improved Sprint** aid survival. **Setup** synergizes perfectly with the higher dodge chance and enables more frequent **Surprise Attack** uses, which is a key damage ability in prolonged fights.
*   **Weapon Flexibility:** The build's core is effective with all melee weapons, with **Tier 6 offering customization** to match your best available weapon.
